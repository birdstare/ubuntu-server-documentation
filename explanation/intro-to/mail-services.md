# Introduction to mail servers

Sending email from one person to another over a network or the Internet requires many systems to work together. First, the sender's email client (**Mail User Agent**) sends the message. Then one or more **Mail Transfer Agents** (MTA) transfers the message. The final MTA sends the message to a **Mail Delivery Agent** (MDA) for delivery to the recipient's inbox. Finally, the recipient's email client retrieves the message, usually via a **POP3** or **IMAP** server. These systems must all be configured correctly to successfully deliver a message.

## Mail User Agent

### Thunderbird
[Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) is the default Mail User Agent (email client) used by Ubuntu. It comes pre-installed on all Ubuntu machines from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) onwards.
  
  If you need to install Thunderbird manually, [this short guide](https://snapcraft.io/install/thunderbird/ubuntu) will walk you through the steps. 

## Mail Transfer Agent

### Postfix
[Postfix](https://www.postfix.org/) is the default MTA on Ubuntu. It is fast, secure and has good flexibility for administrators. It is compatible with the [sendmail](https://www.authsmtp.com/sendmail/index.html) MTA. 
  
  This guide explains {ref}`how to install and configure Postfix <install-postfix>`, including how to configure SMTP for secure communications.

### Exim4
[Exim4](https://www.exim.org/) has extensive configuration features. It can be installed instead of sendmail or Postfix. 
  
  This guide explains {ref}`how to install and configure Exim4 <install-exim4>` on Ubuntu.

## Mail Delivery Agent

### Dovecot
[Dovecot](https://www.dovecot.org/) is an MDA written with security primarily in mind. It supports the [mbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox) and [Maildir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir) mailbox formats. 
  
  This guide explains {ref}`how to set up Dovecot <install-dovecot>` as an IMAP or POP3 server.
